        Var: <br> The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing information.
        <br>
        <br> Let:
        <br> Variables declared with the let keyword can have Block Scope.
        <br>
        <br> Const:
        <br> Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope. But in Const u can not change the value which has been already defined.

        //var
        var cname = "Mercedes"; //declaring car name with value Mercedes
        console.log(cname); //Mercedes is an output

        var a = 3; //declaring a with value 3
        console.log(a); //Output 3

        //let
        let b = "Tanishka";
        console.log(b); //Tanishka will be the output
        b = 2;
        console.log(b); //2

        //const
        const c = 15;
        console.log(c); //15
        //c = 25; //this will give error because in const neither we can redeclare or reassign the variable
        const d = 30;
        console.log(d); //30
